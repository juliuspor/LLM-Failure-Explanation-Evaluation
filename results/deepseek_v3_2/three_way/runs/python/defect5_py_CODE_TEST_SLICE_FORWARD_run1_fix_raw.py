        Return a new list with `element` appended.

        This is a functional-style helper: the input list is not modified. If
        `array` is None, it is treated as an empty list.

        Args:
            array: Source list (may be None).
            element: Element to append.
            expected_type: Optional expected element type used to mirror Java-style
                component type checks in this translated code.
            
        Returns:
            A new list containing the original elements followed by `element`.
            
        Raises:
            TypeError: If `expected_type` is provided and the operation simulates a
                Java array cast failure.
